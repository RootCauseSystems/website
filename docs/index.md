# Systems Thinking. Root Level Security.

**Root Cause Systems** is the professional sandbox of **Rob Hicks**, a Security Compliance Manager and retired U.S. Navy Chief (ETNC). I am leveraging two decades of high-consequence nuclear operations to catapult into the field of **AI Security Engineering**.

In the Nuclear Navy, we learned that systems don't just fail—they are engineered into failure. I am applying that same rigor to the modern AI stack.

### **The Pivot: From Compliance to Adversarial Defense**

I currently manage security compliance, but my mission is to move "Left of Bang." I am building the technical bridge between **regulatory requirements** and **adversarial resilience** in AI.

* **The Foundation:** 20 years of managing nuclear-grade electronics on submarines—where "standard" wasn't good enough.
* **The Current Bridge:** Navigating security compliance frameworks to understand the governance models that will eventually regulate AI.
* **The Future Aim:** Engineering AI systems that are secure by design, focusing on prompt injection defense and model integrity.

### **The Intelligence Stack**

I am documenting my progress through a project-based roadmap:

* **Automated Hardening:** Using **Python** to build security tools like my [Security Header Auditor](/tools/auditor).
* **Edge Intelligence:** Engineering **V.E.R.A.**—a private AI instance running on a **Raspberry Pi 5** to test hardware-level vulnerabilities.
* **Core Systems:** Managing a centralized Home AI on a dedicated **Ubuntu Server** for high-performance model testing.

### **The Responsibility Mandate**

> *"Responsibility is a unique concept... Unless you can point your finger at the man who is responsible when something goes wrong, then you have never had anyone really responsible."*
>
> — **Admiral Hyman G. Rickover**

At **Root Cause Systems**, we don't just patch symptoms. We engineer the solution at the source.
