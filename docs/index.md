# Reliable Systems. Root Level Solutions.

**Root Cause Systems** is the engineering portfolio of a **Retired U.S. Navy Chief** and **IT Professional** dedicated to the discipline of secure, resilient infrastructure.

We believe that true security isn't just about patching bugs—it's about engineering the solution at the root.

### **The Mission**

We are transitioning from traditional IT operations to high-performance systems engineering. This site documents the build-out of secure, automated infrastructure using the modern "Systems Stack":

* **Python:** Automation, AI integration, and Tooling.
* **Go (Golang):** High-concurrency systems and binary deployment.
* **Cloud Native:** Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and serverless architecture.

### **Active Status**

> *"We don't just patch the symptom; we engineer the solution."*

This domain currently serves as a **Documentation Hub** and **Project Sandbox**. Services and tools are in active development.

### **The Philosophy**

> *"Responsibility is a unique concept... You may share it with others, but your portion is not diminished. You may delegate it, but it is still with you... Unless you can point your finger at the man who is responsible when something goes wrong, then you have never had anyone really responsible."*
>
> — **Admiral Hyman G. Rickover**, Father of the Nuclear Navy
