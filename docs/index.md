# Reliable Systems. Root Level Solutions.

**Root Cause Systems** is the engineering portfolio of a **Retired U.S. Navy Chief** and **IT Professional** dedicated to the discipline of secure, resilient infrastructure.

We believe that true security isn't just about patching bugs—it's about engineering the solution at the root.

### **The Mission**

We are transitioning from traditional IT operations to high-performance systems engineering. This site documents the build-out of secure, automated infrastructure using the modern "Systems Stack":

* **Python:** Automation, AI integration, and Tooling.
* **Go (Golang):** High-concurrency systems and binary deployment.
* **Cloud Native:** Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and serverless architecture.

### **Active Status**

> *"We don't just patch the symptom; we engineer the solution."*

This domain currently serves as a **Documentation Hub** and **Project Sandbox**. Services and tools are in active development.
